# 🎓 Comprehensive Programming Lessons

Welcome! This repository serves as a structured knowledge base for mastering various programming languages and computer science concepts. Whether you are a beginner taking your first steps or an experienced developer brushing up on low-level internals, you will find detailed lesson plans and notes here.

## 📂 Curriculum Overview

The coursework is divided into distinct tracks, each focusing on a specific language or domain. Each track guides you from beginner basics to advanced professional practices.

| Track | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🐍 Python** | From variables to async web servers and data science. |
| **☕ Java** | OOP, JVM internals, Spring, and enterprise development. |
| **🔢 C** | Memory management, pointers, and system-level programming. |
| **🚀 C++** | High-performance code, STL, and advanced memory semantics. |
| **🔷 C#** | .NET ecosystem, LINQ, and modern application development. |
| **🌐 JavaScript** | Frontend, Node.js, async patterns, and the DOM. |
| **⚙️ Assembly** | x86/ARM architecture, registers, and hardware interaction. |
| **🖥️ OS Internals** | How operating systems manage resources and processes. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Browse the Lessons
All lessons are written in **Markdown** (`.md`) format for easy reading on GitHub or any text editor. Navigate to the file corresponding to your interest (e.g., `python_lesson_01.md`).

### 2. Convert to HTML (Optional)
This repository includes a utility script to convert the Markdown lessons into HTML files for a better reading experience in your browser.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `markdown` library installed (`pip install markdown`).

**Usage:**
1.  Open your terminal in the project directory.
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python markdown2html.py
    ```
3.  Enter the filename when prompted (e.g., `python_lesson_01.md`).
4.  Open the generated `.html` file in your favorite browser.
